//! # `axes` Main Entry Point
//!
//! This binary file serves as the main entry point for the `axes` application.
//! Its primary responsibilities are minimal and well-defined:
//!
//! 1.  **Initialization**: It initializes logging (in debug builds) and parses command-line
//!     arguments using `clap`.
//! 2.  **Execution**: It orchestrates the core application logic by calling `run_app`, which
//!     in turn delegates to the command dispatcher.
//! 3.  **Error Handling**: It provides a centralized, user-friendly error reporting mechanism
//!     for the entire application, handling specific cases like `clap`'s help/version exits
//!     and Ctrl+C interruptions.
//! 4.  **State Persistence**: After the application logic has completed, it efficiently checks
//!     if the global state has been modified (using the journaling state manager) and, if so,
//!     saves the updated state back to disk.
//!
//! This lean structure ensures that the application's entry point is simple and focused on
//! orchestration, while the complex logic is delegated to other modules.
